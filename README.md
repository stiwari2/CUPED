## CUPED - Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data ##



The variance that pre-experiment data can explain in a metric is unrelated to any effects of the experiment. This variance can be removed. For example- # of number of bookings per property per day 0- 1000s, so variance in this metric can be enormous.  We can use average bookings-per-day for each property before the experiment and compare results against it
At Bing, they were able to reduce variance by about 50%, effectively achieving the same statistical power with only half of the users, or half the duration
